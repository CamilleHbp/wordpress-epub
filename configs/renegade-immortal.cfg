 <p>Wang Lin is a very smart boy with loving parents. Although him and
 his parents are shunned by the rest of their relatives, his parents
 always held high hopes that he will one day become someone great. One
 day, Wang Lin suddenly gained the chance to walk the path of an
 immortal, but found that he only had mediocre talent at best. Watch
 Wang Lin as he breaks through his lack of talent and walks the path
 towards becoming a real immortal!</p>
